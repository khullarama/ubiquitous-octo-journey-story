Outside, the rain poured 'splat, splat, splat'.  It was nothing signifant, compa
red with the Indian monsoons that she would twirl around in Marine Drive in Bomb
ay during her early childhood summers.  It was April and this was rain in New Yo
rk, in one of those suburban pockets tucked in close to the city.

Nevertheless, if she could not twirl in it, she could dwell on this rain;  she c
ould ponder about him and sit by her windowsill and pen down her thoughts.  It w
as her closest attempt to re-experience something at the hands of Mother Nature.
  After all, so many of her favorite Indian movies--that were part of Bollywood,
 India's version of Hollywood--spun romantic tales, with heroes and heroines dan
cing merrily to the "splats" of the raindrops and drumming of the thunder.  Some
 of that dancing, with its frequent hops, skips, and jumps, and swinging around
trees reminded her of monkeys dancing yonder.
